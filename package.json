  "description": "Implement a fully functioning tic-tac-toe board in JavaScript and CSS that can be playable by two people at the same computer. When a winning move is played, raise an alert that displays the winning player in the modal. After clicking OK, a new game should start. When a game move is made that casts the game to a draw, raise an alert that displays \"Draw\", and resets the game after clicking OK. You will use CSS and JavaScript to make this happen.",
